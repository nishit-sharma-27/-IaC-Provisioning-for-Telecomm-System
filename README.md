Subject: DevOps

Project Type: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Automation

Group No: D6 - Group 08

Project No: DO-19

Project Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project focuses on automating the provisioning of infrastructure for a Telecom system using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. The objective is to eliminate manual configuration errors and create a repeatable, scalable, and reliable environment setup.
The system provisions either local Docker-based environments or cloud instances (such as AWS or similar platforms) using script-driven automation. It also supports automated installation and configuration of core dependencies such as Terraform or Ansible. By defining infrastructure in code, the system ensures consistent deployment across development, testing, and production environments.

Project Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The IaC Provisioning system acts as an automated deployment framework for telecom infrastructure. Instead of manually setting up servers, containers, or orchestration platforms, the entire infrastructure is defined in configuration files and version-controlled.

When a deployment is triggered:

🔹 Infrastructure code is fetched from a Git repository.

🔹 IaC scripts provision required compute resources.

🔹 Docker environments or cloud instances are created.

🔹 Required services and dependencies are installed automatically.

🔹 Telecom applications are deployed inside containerized environments.

🔹 The infrastructure is validated to ensure successful setup.

🔹 This process enables zero-manual-intervention deployment and easy reproducibility.

Objectives
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔹 Automation: Replace manual server provisioning with script-based deployments.

🔹 Consistency: Ensure identical infrastructure across all environments.

🔹 Scalability: Allow telecom systems to scale dynamically when needed.

🔹 Reliability: Minimize human errors and configuration drift.

🔹 Reproducibility: Enable infrastructure recreation using version-controlled code.

🔹 Efficiency: Reduce setup time and operational overhead.


##  Tech Stack

| Category | Tools/Technologies Used |
| :--- | :--- |
| **IaC & Orchestration** | Terraform, Kubernetes (K8s), Docker |

Key Features
----------------------
🔹 Automated Infrastructure Setup

Infrastructure is defined in code (Terraform files or Ansible playbooks) allowing one-command deployment.

🔹 CI/CD Integration

Deployment pipeline automatically provisions infrastructure upon code changes.

🔹 Local & Cloud Deployment Support

Supports both:

Local Docker-based development environments

Cloud-based infrastructure provisioning

🔹 Dependency Automation

Automatically installs required tools and services without manual intervention.

🔹 Scalable Environment

Expected Benefits
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔹Faster infrastructure setup

🔹Reduced manual errors

🔹Consistent environments

🔹Easier rollback and updates

🔹Improved scalability
